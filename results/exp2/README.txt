# Setup for the second experiment
data: mnist and rcv1, iid distributed
task: softmax for mnist; softmax for rcv1
number of clients: 100

Try different \tau and \epsilon
- participation rate: 0.3, epsilon = 1e-3 (100 rounds)
- participation rate: 0.1, epsilon = 1e-3 (500 rounds)
- participation rate: 0.05, epsilon = ? (500~1000 rounds)
